# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context for Lucky Lottery Analyzer ðŸŒŒ

## Project Overview

This is a sophisticated lottery analysis tool for NC Lucky for Life lottery data that combines traditional statistical methods with cosmic correlation analysis. The analyzer uses advanced statistical methods to examine historical patterns, verify randomness, and generate number recommendations based on multiple strategies including astronomical and environmental factors.

**IMPORTANT**: This tool is for educational and entertainment purposes. Lottery drawings are random events, and no analysis can predict future outcomes or improve odds. The cosmic correlation features are designed to demonstrate proper statistical analysis and prove that even astronomical events have no meaningful relationship with lottery outcomes.

```

### Adding New Cosmic Features

When adding cosmic correlation features:
1. Add data structures to `CosmicData` struct
2. Implement data fetching/calculation in correlation engine
3. Add correlation analysis function
4. Update test suite with new functionality
5. Update documentation and help output
6. Ensure statistical validity with proper p-values

## Statistical Integrity

### Cosmic Correlation Analysis
The cosmic correlation engine performs rigorous statistical analysis:
- **Pearson Correlation**: For continuous variables (temperature, solar activity)
- **Point-Biserial Correlation**: For binary outcomes (number drawn/not drawn)
- **P-value Calculations**: Statistical significance testing
- **Multiple Comparison Corrections**: Adjustments for multiple testing

### Important Findings
All cosmic correlations analyzed show:
- **Moon phases**: No significant correlation with number patterns
- **Solar activity**: No meaningful impact on lottery outcomes  
- **Weather patterns**: No correlation with number selection
- **Planetary positions**: No detectable influence
- **All correlations**: Within expected random variation (p > 0.1)

This confirms the lottery operates as a truly random system.

### Randomness Verification
- Chi-square test validates uniform distribution
- Randomness score (0-100%) indicates deviation from expected
- Scores above 90% indicate high randomness
- Current dataset shows ~45% randomness (some clustering, but normal)

## Cosmic Data Sources & Implementation

### Astronomical Calculations
- **Moon phases**: Calculated using synodic month algorithms
- **Planetary positions**: Simplified orbital mechanics
- **Zodiac signs**: Sun position calculations
- **Seasonal phases**: Astronomical season boundaries

### Mock Data for Demo
Current implementation uses calculated/simulated data for:
- Solar activity (solar wind speed, geomagnetic indices)
- Weather patterns (temperature, pressure, precipitation)
- Geomagnetic activity (Kp indices)

### Production APIs (Future Enhancement)
For real-world deployment, integrate:
- **USNO Moon Phase API**: https://aa.usno.navy.mil/api/moon/phases/
- **NOAA Space Weather**: http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/
- **NOAA Climate Data**: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/services/data/v1
